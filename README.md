Java Swing Multi Window Demos

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield

Three demos to show how to create and interact with pop-up windows in Java Swing.

The first passes no data between the windows, but just creates and destroys them.
The second passes data "down" to a pop-up window.
The third gets data ("up") froma pop-up window.
